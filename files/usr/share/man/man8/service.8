.SH SYNOPSIS
       service \fBSCRIPT\fR \fBCOMMAND\fR [\fBOPTIONS\fR]

       service --help | -h | --version

.SH DESCRIPTION
service runs a System V init script in as predictable environment as
possible, removing most environment variables and with current working
directory set to /.
.PP
The  \fBSCRIPT\fR  parameter  specifies  a  System  V init script, located in
/etc/init.d/\fBSCRIPT\fR.  The supported values  of  \fBCOMMAND\fR  depend  on  the
invoked  script,  service  passes  \fBCOMMAND\fR  and  \fBOPTIONS\fR it to the init
script unmodified.  All scripts should support at least the  start  and
stop  commands.   As  a special case, if \fBCOMMAND\fR is \-\-full-restart, the
script is run twice, first with the stop command, then with  the  start
command.

service \-\-status-all runs all init scripts, in alphabetical order, with
the status command.
